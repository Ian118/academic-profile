Howdy!  
My name is Ian Lansdowne, and I'm a Mechanical Engineer and Roboticist. I recently graduated from Texas A&M University with my BS in Mechanical Engineering. During my undergrad, I was the president of the largest robotics organization at Texas A&M, [TURTLE Robotics](https://turtlerobotics.org), and I worked for NASA and [RAD Lab](https://rad.engr.tamu.edu). My interest revolve around developing robotic systems, including space applications for robots and biomimetic robotics.

Please look around my site and see my [projects](/portfolio) and [publications](/publications). This site is still under development, and I will be making frequent changes to fill in some of my past projects.
