This soft gripper was developed for MEEN-408 _Mechanics of Robotic Manipulators_ to grasp a large variety of household objects using a UR3e robotic arm. For simplicity, the design is limited to a single degree of freedom: a slider actuated by a servo to close the gripper. My contribution was the gripper design, which uses the [fin ray effect](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2025.116711) to concentrate force on the grasped object and comply the gripper to its surface. I designed the linear actuator to apply tension at the bottom of the inner finger, bending it and applying force to the object.

I 3D-printed the bottom shell and slider from hard PLA plastic and the fin ray fingers from flexible 95A TPU. To increase the coefficient of friction at the fingertips, I applied 3M GM641 grip tape. The mesh, made from the protective EPE foam for a papaya, encapsulates objects within the gripper and has proved effective when grasping multiple objects at once.

The design successfully grasped 23/43 objects, and was third most effective of 8 teams. It met the design requirements to interface with a ZigBee radio module, attach to the UR3e, and grasp at least 5 household objects.
